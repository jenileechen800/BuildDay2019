# BuildDay2019 (UBCNav)

A project built during UBC Local Hack Day 2019. Meant to improve on UBC's current wayfinding application(tells people how to get around UBC). Built using Android Studio and Java, the project was meant to be a central hub for students to access UBC amenities like food places, study spots, and routes to buildings. Implemented the Google Maps API, and created a wireframe to demonstrate what the final product should look like https://www.figma.com/file/1PcE4cg8t5iXaAhAG0GNe6/Hackathon?node-id=0%3A1.

Made in collaboration with briellelaw, jenileechen800, and aliceeeh0331
